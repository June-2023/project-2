The news popularity data include different variables, and aims to predict the number of shares. According to the instruction, the data was summarized based on selected variables. The statistics based on the variables of day of the week, different content length categories, avg_positive_polarity, and num_keywords were summarized within the training dataset. A linear regression model, an ensemble tree-based model, a random forest model, and a boosted tree model were created and compared.

• what would you do differently?
   
There are tens of variables in the news popularity data, besides the variables applied for summarizations, more variables such as num_imgs, kw_min_avg, rate_negative_words can be summarized. In addition to the plots and Tables in the summarization, more figures can be applied to analyze the data, such as boxplots and the correlation of different variables.


• what was the most difficult part for you?
There are some challenges in working on the project, such as code writing and finding suitable models. The most difficult parts include the ensemble tree-based model, boosted tree model, and automation. 

• what are your big take-aways from this project?
From the project, I familiarized the whole process of analyzing data, model fitting and automation, also learned the code writing in the process.
